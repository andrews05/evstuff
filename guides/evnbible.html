Therefore, when a field in the Nova data file is said torefer to a government, stellar object, etc., it refers to it by its index number(starts at 0) unless it is specifically stated that it is referring to the IDnumber, which starts at 128.<b>Note:</b>Some of Nova's fields refer to other resource IDs or index numbers, but theirvalues are offset by a certain amount to indicate type. For example, the m&iuml;snresource's AvailStel field refers to the index number of a g&ouml;vt resource whenits value is between 10000 and 10255. In cases like this, it is necessary to addto or subtract from the field in order to force the value into the proper range:in this instance, you'd subtract 10000 to find the index number of the g&ouml;vt.<b>Note:</b>Any resources in an Nova plugin file automatically replace same-numbered resourcesin Nova&rsquo;s main files. Resources are loaded from the "Nova Files" folder firstand then resources from the "Nova Plug-Ins" folder are loaded.<div class="divider"></div>A quick word about control bits and scripting in EV Nova:Mission bits exist as they did in previous incarnations of EV. This time around,there are 10,000 bits available for your use, and they are accessed muchdifferently from previous versions. For this reason, they are referred to asNova control bits (ncb's). Control bits are accessed through logical expressionsthat allow much more powerful and logical mission scripting. These expressions aredivided into two types - test and set:Test expressions:These are boolean expressions that are used to determine when something happens;for example, when a mission is to be offered, or when a particular ship shouldbe made available for purchase. In general, if the logical expression defined ina given test expression field evaluates to be true (nonzero), the associatedproperty will be activated (mission becomes available, ship appears, etc.).The following terms and operators are supported: (capitalization doesn't matter)Bxxx   Lookup the value of control bit xxx. Bits are numbered from b0 to b9999.Pxxx   Check if the game is registered ([P]aid for) ... evaluates to 1 if       the game is registered or is unregistered but less than xxx days have       elapsed. Evaluates to 0 only if unregistered for more than xxx days.G      Lookup the player's gender - 1 if male, 0 if femaleOxxx   Returns 1 if the player has at least one of outfit item ID xxx, 0 if notExxx   Returns 1 if the player has explored system ID xxx, 0 if not|      Logical or operator&amp;      Logical and operator!      Logical negation operator( )    Parenthetical enclosureSome examples:b13 &amp; (b15 | !b72)!(B42 | B53) &amp; b103Note that since the Nova evaluator is fairly primitive, it may do unpredictablethings if you give it an expression like b1 &amp; b2 | b3 ... instead, use properparentheses to make it b1 &amp; (b2 | b3) or (b1 &amp; b2) | b3, as appropriate.Also note that if you leave the field for a test expression blank, it willevaluate to true as a default.Also also note:  The Oxxx operator also considers any carried fighters that aredeployed when it examines the player's current list of outfits, although thisfeature may be confused if presented with a universe that includes multiplefighter bay weapons that launch the same ship type, or different outfits thatgrant the same fighter bay ammo.Set expressions:These are simpler than the test expressions... basically all you are doing hereis listing what bits you want to be modified when the expression in a givenfield is invoked. This will happen when the player does something (completes amission, buys an item, etc.) as defined by the other resources. The syntax ofset expressions is best illustrated by an example:b1 b2 !b3 ^b4In this set expression, bits 1 and 2 will be set, bit 3 will be cleared, and bit4 will be toggled to the opposite of whatever it was previously. No parenthesesare supported for set expressions. Note that if you leave a set expressionblank, no control bits will be altered.One other feature of the set expression is the ability to make random decisions.By specifying   R(&lt;op1&gt; &lt;op2&gt;)   you can make Nova randomly pick one of the twopossible choices and execute it, skipping the other one. For example:b1 R(b2 !b3)...this expression will set bit 1, and then *either* set bit 2 *or* clear bit 3,but not both at once. Which operation will be picked is completely random, whichallows for the design of interesting mission strings that branch unpredictably.There are also a number of other operators that allow you to do many interestingthings:Axxx - if mission ID xxx is currently active, abort it.Fxxx - if mission ID xxx is currently active, cause it to fail.Sxxx - start mission ID xxx automatically. Gxxx - grant one of outfit item ID xxx to the playerDxxx - remove (Delete) one of outfit item ID xxx from the playerMxxx - move the player to system xxx. The player will be put on top of the       first stellar in the system, or in the center of the system if no       stellars exist there.Nxxx - move the player to system xxx. The player will remain at the same       x/y coordinates, relative to the center of the system.Cxxx - change the player's ship to ship type (ID) xxx. The player will keep all       of his previous outfit items and won't be given any of the default       weapons or items that come with ship type xxx.       Exxx - change the player's ship to ship type (ID) xxx. The player will keep all       of his previous outfit items and will also be given all of the default       weapons and items that come with ship type xxx.       Hxxx - change the player's ship to ship type (ID) xxx. The player will lose any       nonpersistent outfit items he previously had, but will be given all of       the default weapons and items that come with ship type xxx.Kxxx - activate rank ID xxx.Lxxx - deactivate rank ID xxx.Pxxx - play sound with ID xxx.Yxxx - destroy stellar ID xxx.Uxxx - regenerate (Un-destroy) stellar ID xxx.Qxxx - make the player immediately leave (absquatulate) whatever stellar he's       landed on and return to space, and show a message at the bottom of the       screen. The message is randomly selected from the STR# resource with       ID xxx, and is parsed for mission text tags (e.g. &lt;PSN&gt; and &lt;PRK&gt; )       but not text-selection tags like those above (e.g. {G "he" "she"} )       (see d&euml;sc and m&iuml;sn resource descriptions for more examples)       Txxx - change the name (Title) of the player's ship to a string randomly       selected from STR# resource ID xxx. The previous ship name will be       substituted for any '*' characters which are encountered in the       new string.Xxxx - make system ID xxx be explored.<div class="divider"></div><a class="contentH2" name="spin">The sp&iuml;n resource</a>Spin resources contain sprite info for simple graphical objects. WheneverNova needs to load a set of sprites for a particular object, it looks at thatobjects's spin resource, which in turn tells the game how to load the object'ssprites. Nova sprites are stored as paired sprite and mask PICT resources, or asrleD/rle8 resources. The sprites in each PICT are arranged in a grid, which canbe of any size. The spin resource tells Nova what shape and size the sprites'grid is. Spin resources have the following fields:SpritesID  ID number of the sprites' PICT resource (or the ID of the rleD/rle8resource)MasksID    ID number of the masks' PICT resourcexSize      Horizontal size of each spriteySize      Vertical size of each spritexTiles     Horizontal grid dimension yTiles     Vertical grid dimension Spin resources have certain reserved ID numbers, which correspond to differenttypes of objects:400-463      Explosions500          Cargo boxes501-504      Mini-asteroids for mining600-605      Main menu buttons606          Main screen logo607          Main screen rollover images608-610      Main screen sliding buttons650          Target cursor700          Starfield800-815      Asteroids1000-1255    Stellar objects3000-3255    WeaponsIt is important to note that the ID numbers of the PICT/rleD/rle8 resources arenon-critical, as Nova looks at the spin resources to find the sprites, and notat the actual PICT/rleD/rle8 ID numbers themselves.<div class="divider"></div><a class="contentH2" name="shan">The sh&auml;n resource</a>Shan (ship animation) resources contain sprite info for ship graphics, whichare too complex for the more rudimentary spin resource.BaseImageID     The resource ID of the basic sprite images for this shipBaseMaskID      The ID of the corresponding sprite masks (ignored if the base                  image is an rleD/rle8 resource)BaseSetCount    The number of sprite sets for the basic sprite images. A sprite                  set is usually 36 sprite images, and the graphics for all of                  a ship's basic sprite sets are stored in the samePICT/rleD/rle8                  resource, referred to in BaseImageID.                  BaseXSize       The X size of each basic sprite imageBaseYSize       The Y size of each basic sprite imageBaseTransp      The inherent transparency of the basic sprite images, from                  0 (no transparency) to 32 (fully transparent).AltImageID      The resource ID of the alternating sprite images for this ship.                  Sprites from the alt sprite sets can be displayed on top of                  the basic sprite for the ship, cycling through each available                  sprite set at a rate defined in the Delay field, below.                  Set to zero if unused.                  AltMaskID       The corresponding mask ID. Set to zero if unused.AltSetCount     The number of sprite sets for the alternating sprites.AltXSizeAltYSizeGlowImageID     Engine glowGlowMaskIDGlowXSizeGlowYSizeLightImageID    Running lightsLightMaskIDLightXSizeLightYSizeWeapImageID     Weapon effectsWeapMaskIDWeapXSizeWeapYSizeShieldImageID     Shield bubble (shield sprite have a number of framesShieldMaskID       exactly equal to 1, FramesPer, or BaseSetCount*FramesPer)ShieldXSizeShieldYSizeFlags      0x0001    Extra frames in base image are used to display banking.                       The first set of sprites is used for level flight, the                       second for banking left, and the third for banking right.           0x0002    Extra frames in base image are used for animated ship                       parts such as for folding/unfolding wings. The sprites                       will be cycled upon landing, taking off, and                       entering/exiting hyperspace.           0x0004    The second set of frames in the base image are displayed                       when the ship is not carrying any of its KeyCarried type                       ships onboard.           0x0008    Extra frames in base image are shown in sequence, just                       like the sprites in the alternating image. The AnimDelay                       field has the same effect in this case.           0x0010    Stop the ships' animations when it is disabled           0x0020    Hide alt sprites when the ship is disabled           0x0040    Hide running light sprites when the ship is disabled           0x0080    Ship unfolds when firing weapons, and folds back up when                      not firing.           0x0100    Adjust ship's visual presentation to correct for the skew                      caused by graphics that are rendered highly off-axis from                      vertical. This uses the ship's UpCompressY and DnCompressY                      fields to interpolate the proper sprite frame to display                      based on the ship's actual heading. Use this with                      caution, as it tends to cause very jerky ship                      rotation and is mostly included as a curiosity.                                 Note that the first four flags in this field are mutually             exclusive - i.e. you can have a ship that banks, unfolds,             changes appearance when it is carrying a certain other ship             type, or animates in sequence, but these effects can't be             combined. The only exception is that having both flags             0x0001 and 0x0002 set is treated specially - it results in             a ship whose extra frames are used for banking and which             always displays its engine glow when it is turning, whether             or not it is actually accelerating. (This something that             got thrown in at some point when I realized that it would             be necessary to have in order to replicate the behavior of             a certain type of ship from a certain TV show).           AnimDelay  The delay between frames of the sprite animations, in 30ths of a             second.WeapDecay  The rate at which the weapon glow sprite fades out to transparency,             if applicable. 50 is a good median number - lower numbers yield             slower decays.FramesPer  The number of frames for one rotation of this ship - usually 36 is             a good number, but larger ships can benefit from having more             frames per rotation to make their turning animation look smoother.             Be sure this value is equal to the actual number of frames per             revolution in your images, or bad things will happen!BlinkMode  0 or -1  Ignored           1        Square-wave blinking:                       BlinkValA is the light on-time                       BlinkValB is the delay between blinks                       BlinkValC is the number of blinks in a group                       BlinkValD is the delay between groups           2        Triangle-wave pulsing:                       BlinkValA is the minimum intensity (1-32)                       BlinkValB is the intensity increase per frame, x100                       BlinkValC is the maximum intensity (1-32)                       BlinkValD is the intensity decrease per frame, x100           3        Random pulsing:                       BlinkValA is the minimum intensity (1-32)                       BlinkValB is the maximum intensity (1-32)                       BlinkValC is the delay between intensity changes                       BlinkValD is ignoredGunPosX        Here you can set the exit points on the ship sprite for fourGunPosY         different classes of weapons. Note that The "Gun" "Beam" etc.TurretPosX      designations are for convenience only, since which set ofTurretPosY      weapon exit points is used by a given weapon are defined inGuidedPosX      that weapon's ExitType field. The x &amp; y positions of each GuidedPosY      weapon exit point are measured in pixels from the center of theBeamPosX        ship when the ship is pointing straight up (frame index 0). SeeBeamPosY        the next four fields if you need to account for any perspective                corrections in your sprites.                UpCompressX    If you have ship sprites that are rendered at an angle, theseUpCompressY     fields are used to correct for the ships perspective whenDnCompressX     calculating the weapon exit points (above). If the ship isDnCompressY     pointing generally "up" (heading is 0-90 or 270-359) then                UpCompressX/Y are used; if the ship is pointing generally                "down" (heading is 91-269 degrees) then DnCompressX/Y are used.                These values are divided by 100 and then multiplied by the                rotated x &amp; y values in the weapon exit point fields to apply a                rough correction factor, so values less that 100 will bring                the exit points in closer to the ship and values greater than                100 will move the exit points farther out. Experimentation is                the best way to learn how this works. Values of zero are                interpreted the same as a value of 100, so you can leave                this field set to zero if unused.GunPosZ        Here you can set further weapon exit point offsets in order toTurretPosZ      compensate for skew caused by the z position of a shipGuidedPosZ      graphic's weapon exit point. These values are added to aBeamPosZ        shot or beam's position after the weapon exit point x &amp; y                offsets and the x &amp; y compression factors have been applied,                so the effect of these values is not scaled. Positive values                here move up the screen, negative values move down the screen.                (this is a lot easier to use with the editor than it is to                describe)<b>Note:</b>if you use engine glows or running lights, you must have the same numberof engine glow and/or running light frames as base frames (including bankingframes!) or Nova will choke.<div class="divider"></div><a class="contentH2" name="boom">The b&ouml;&ouml;m resource</a>The boom resource is used to customize the various explosion types. Novasupports up to 64 different explosion types. The graphics for the explosions areloaded from sp&iuml;n resources 400-463, the sounds are loaded from snd resources300-363, and the behavior of each explosion type is contained within b&ouml;&ouml;mresources 128-191. Each b&ouml;&ouml;m resource contains three fields:FrameAdvance   The rate at which the explosion will animate - a value of 100                will cause each frame of the explosion to appear for exactly                one frame of the game animation, and lower values will stretch                out the explosion animation and make it stay onscreen longer.SoundIndex     The index (0-63) of the explosion sound to associate with this                explosion type, or -1 for a silent explosion. Usually you'd set                this to either -1 or to the same value as the explosion index                itself (e.g. 1 for b&ouml;&ouml;m resource 129, etc.) but if you want to                use the same sound for two different explosion types, you can                do that with this field.                GraphicIndex   The index (0-63) of the explosion graphic to associate with this                explosion type. Usually you'd set this to the same value as the                explosion index itself (e.g. 1 for b&ouml;&ouml;m resource 129, etc.) but                if you want to use the same graphic for two different explosion                types (like the small weapon explosion and the ship-breaking-up                explosion) you can do that with this field.<div class="divider"></div><a class="contentH2" name="char">The ch&auml;r resource</a>The ch&auml;r resource is used to allow multiple entry points into the scenario'sstoryline, by letting the player pick a "character template" from a list when anew pilot is started. The player is presented with a list of all available ch&auml;rresources when a new pilot is created, and must choose one (but only one). Thisallows different character types to have different ships, legal records, etc. atthe start of the game, and also allows for the setting-up of mission stuff byway of a control bit set string that is evaluated when a new pilot is started.Cash          The amount of money a player gets when starting out with this               character type                ShipType      ID number of the starting ship typeSystem1-4     ID numbers of up to four possible starting systems for the               player. The player will randomly be placed in one of these               systems when starting out. Set to -1 if unused (if all four of               these fields are set to -1, the player will be placed in system               ID 128 as a default).               Govt1-4 &amp;     For each of the governments whose ID is entered in a Govt1-4Status1-4      field, the player's legal status in systems owned by that               government or one of its allies is set to the value in the               corresponding Status field. For systems owned by an enemy               of the govt identified in the Govt field, the player's legal               status is set to the negative value of the number in the               corresponding Status field. Set unused Govt fields to -1.               Kills         The player's starting combat rating.IntroPict1-4  IDs of up to four PICT resources to show in sequence when the               player starts out with a new pilot of this type. Set to -1               if unused.PictDelay1-4  Maximum delay time to display each of the four above pictures,               in seconds.IntroTextID   The ID of the d&euml;sc resource to show when the player starts out               with a new pilot of this type. Along with the IntroPictID field,               this allow you to have different opening sequences for each               pilot type (useful to show different sides of the same issue,               for example). Using the d&euml;sc resource's MovieFile field here               lets you have an introduction movie. The intro text (and any               associated movie) is displayed after the above PICT resouces               are shown.               OnStart       A control bit set string that is called when the player starts               out with a new pilot of this type.Flags         0x0001    Denotes the "default" ch&auml;r resource, which will be                         automatically selected in the popup menu. If more                         than one ch&auml;r resource has this bit set (there                         shouldn't be) the one with the lowest ID will be                         considered the default.                         StartYear     The starting year of the game.DatePrefix    String that is appended to the start of the date whenever               it's displayed.DateSuffix    String that is appended to the end of the date whenever               it's displayed.<div class="divider"></div><a class="contentH2" name="colr">The c&ouml;lr resource</a>The c&ouml;lr resource allows you to customize some game-wide interfaceoptions.ButtonUp          Normal button text colorButtonDown        Pressed button text colorButtonGrey        Greyed-out button text colorMenuFont          Main menu font nameMenuFontSize      Size of main menu fontMenuColor1 &amp; 2    Bright &amp; dim colors for main menuGridDim           Shipyard/outfit dialog grid colorGridBright        Shipyard/outfit dialog selection square colorProgressBar       Position and shape of the loading progress bar, relative to                   the center of the window                   ProgBright        Bright progress bar colorProgDim           Dim progress bar colorProgOutline       Progress bar outline colorButton1x &amp; y      Position of the six main menu buttons, relative to the  through          top left corner of a 1024x768 main menu backgroundButton6x &amp; yFloatingMap       Floating hyperspace map / escort menu border colorListText          List text colorListBkgnd         List background colorListHilite        List hilite colorEscortHilite      Escort menu item hilite colorButtonFont        Button font nameButtonFontSz      Size of button fontLogoX &amp; Y         Logo animation x/y positionRolloverX &amp; Y     Rollover animation x/y positionSlide1x &amp; y       Sliding button x/y positions  throughSlide3x &amp; yThe various interface buttons that appear are drawn on the fly. Novauses PICT resources 7500-7502 for the left, center, and right pieces of the"up" buttons, PICT resources 7503-7505 for the "down" button pieces, and PICTresources 7506-7508 for the greyed-out button pieces. Corresponding mask imagesare stored in PICTs 7600-7608. STR# resource 150 is used to store the text thatappears on each button type.Note that all color fields in the c&ouml;lr resource are encoded the same asHTML colors, and that only the first c&ouml;lr resource is loaded.<div class="divider"></div><a class="contentH2" name="cron">The cr&ouml;n resource</a>Cron resources are used to define time-dependent events that occur in amanner that is invisible to the player but can cause interesting things tohappen in the universe, via the manipulation of control bits. With it, you cancreate such things as:  - an event that occurs periodically during the course of the game  - an event that occurs at some fixed date during the game, as part of the    story's set script  - an event, triggered by the actions of the player, that occurs after some    fixed or random interval  - etc.FirstDay      The first day of the month (1-31) on which the cron event can be                activated. If you set this to 0 or -1, this field will be                ignored and only FirstMonth and FirstYear will be considered.FirstMonth    The first month of the year (1-12) on which the cron event can                be activated. Set to 0 or -1 for this to be ignored.FirstYear     The first year in which the cron event can be activated. Set to                0 or -1 for this to be ignored.                LastDay       The last day of the month (1-31) on which the cron event can                be activated. Set to 0 or -1 for this to be ignored.LastMonth     The last month of the year (1-12) on which the cron event can                be activated. Set to 0 or -1 for this to be ignored.LastYear      The last year in which the cron event can be activated. Set to                0 or -1 for this to be ignored.Random        The percent chance that the cron event will be activated during                the date range defined above. Set to 100 for the event to                be activated as soon as it can be.Duration      The duration during which the event is active, in days. If this               is set to zero, the event will start and end on the same day,               i.e. its OnStart and OnEnd scripts will be run at the same time.PreHoldoff    The number of days to "hold" the event in a waiting state after               it is activated and before it starts. Set this to zero to have               the event start immediately when it is activated.               PostHoldoff   The number of days to hold the event in a waiting state after it               ends and before it is deactivated. This is used to keep a               repeating event from being activated immediately after it has               just happened. Set this to zero to have the event be deactivated               immediately after it ends.               Flags         0x0001    Continuous, iterative cron entry - keep evaluating                         the cron's OnStart field until the EnableOn expression                         is no longer true or the constraints of the Require                         fields are no longer met. This can create infinite                         loops, so be careful!              0x0002    Continuous, iterative cron exit - keep evaluating                         the cron's OnExit field until the EnableOn expression                         is no longer true or the constraints of the Require                         fields are no longer met. This can create infinite                         loops, so be careful!EnableOn      A control bit test string that is used to determine whether the               cron event is eligible to be activated or not. Leave this               blank if you are creating an event whose activation doesn't               depend on the state of any control bits.               OnStart       A control bit set string that is called when the cron event               starts, after waiting through the PreHoldoff time, if any.               OnEnd         A control bit set string that is called when the cron event               ends. Contribute    When the cron event is active, these two Contribute fieldsContribute     together form a 64-bit flag that is subsequently combined with               the Contribute fields from the player's ship and the other               outfit items in the player's possession, to be used with the               Require fields in the outf and misn resources.  Require       These two Require fields together form a 64-bit flag that isRequire        logically and'ed with the Contribute fields from the player's               current ship and outfit items. Unless for each 1 bit in the               Require fields there is a matching 1 bit in one or more of the               Contribute fields, the cron will not be activated. Leave these               set to zero if unused.  NewsGovt1-4     On planets or stations that are allied with the governmentGovtNewsStr1-4   whose ID is given by one of the NewsGovt fields, a string                 will be randomly selected from the STR# resource whose                 ID is given by the corresponding GovtNewsStr field, and                 will be displayed as news while the cron event is active.                 This allows you to let up to four different governments                 (and their allies) have their own "local news" for a given                 cron event. Set unused NewsGovt and GovtNewsStr fields to -1.  IndNewsStr      The ID of a STR# resource from which to randomly select a                 string to be displayed in the news dialog while this cron                 event is in progress, if it doesn't have any applicable local                 news. Set to -1 for no independent news.                 Some notes:1. Setting any of the above date fields to 0 or -1 effectively makes that   field a wildcard field, which will match to anything.2. If you want an event with a wide possible date range to be guaranteed to   never run more than once, make it set a control bit in its OnEnd script that   will prevent it from subsequently being eligible for activation.3. The 'M' and 'N' control bit set string operators should probably not be used   in conjunction with cron events, unless you really want to confuse the   player by moving him around at seemingly random times.4. Local news always takes precedence over independent news, even if there is   no corresponding news string to display (the STR# ID must still be greater   than zero to not be ignored). You can use this to make everyone in the   universe except a particular government or set of governments report on   something, for example.<div class="divider"></div><a class="contentH2" name="desc">The d&euml;sc resource</a>Desc resources store null-terminated text strings (descriptions) that areused by Nova in a variety of places. For some desc resources, Nova looks for acertain reserved ID number. Other desc resources are pointed to by fields inother resources, so their ID numbers are not necessarily fixed, and can be setto virtually anything by the scenario designer. The reserved desc ID numbers,along with the maximum length for each type, are below:128-2175        Stellar object descriptions, shown when landed on a planet. 3000-3511       Outfit item descriptions, shown in ship outfitting dialog.4000-4999       Mission descriptions, shown in mission dialog. 13000-13767     Ship class descriptions, shown in the shipyard and                 requisition-escort dialog. 13999           Message shown after the player uses an escape pod.14000-14767     Ship pilot descriptions, shown in the hire-escort dialog. 32760-32767     ReservedIf you wish, you can make a d&euml;sc resource mutable via control bits - embedding aspecial sequence of characters into the d&euml;sc resource will instruct Nova tochange the contents of the text on the fly. This sequence is delimited (marked)by the characters "{" and "}", and follows this format:{bXXX "string one" "string two"}Where "XXX" is be replaced by the index of the control bit you wish to test. Youcan add in a "!" character before the "bXXX" test in order to negate the resultof the test, but unlike the control bit test strings, you cannot performcompound tests in a d&euml;sc resource - i.e., no testing of multiple bits at a time.If the bit test (after being negated, if the "!" character is present) evaluatesto true, the first string will be substituted in place of all the charactersbetween (and including) the "{" and "}" characters. If the bit test evaluates tofalse and there is a second string in the expression, that second string will besubstituted. If there is no second string, nothing will be substituted.For example, consider this d&euml;sc resource:This is a {b001 "great and terrific" "lousy, terrible"} example....if bit 001 is set, the output will be "This is a great and terrific example."If bit 001 is not set, the output will be "This is a lousy, terrible example.".Also note that if you want to include a quotation mark (") character in eitherof the two strings, use standard C syntax to do it:My name is {b002 "Dave \"pipeline\" Williams"}This is also works with the player's gender - for example:This is a test string and the player is {G "a male character" "a female pilot"}....in this case, the G character signifies that the following text is mutablebased on the player's gender; if the player is male, the first string is used,otherwise the second string is used. Note that the "!" token works here asusual.You can also change the text based on whether or not the player is registered:This is a test string you {P "have paid" "haven't paid"}....in this case, the P character signifies that the following text is mutablebased on whether or not the game is registered; if the player has registered,the first string is used, otherwise the second string is used. Note that the"!" token works here as usual, and you can also append a number to the Pcharacter to specify a number of days, just as you can with the ncb Pxxxtest operator.Besides the Description field in the d&euml;sc resource, there are some additionalfields:Graphic        This is used to include graphics in mission briefings. If you                put in the ID of a valid PICT resource, Nova will display that                image along with the description text when it displays a                mission dialog box (with the exception of the Mission Computer                and Mission Info dialogs).                MovieFile      The name of a QuickTime movie file to display before the                briefing dialog appears. This file must reside either in                "Nova Files" or "Nova Plugins".Flags          0x0001    Show the movie after the briefing instead of before               0x0002    Show movie at double-size               0x0004    Cinematic movie - blank background and fade screen                          before and after <div class="divider"></div><a class="contentH2" name="dude">The d&uuml;de resource</a>A dude resource can be thought of as a container for ships that sharecertain characteristics. Any ship of a given dude class will have that dudeclass's AI type and governmental affiliation, and will yield the same types ofbooty when boarded. In a dude resource, up to 16 different ship classes can bepointed to, with a probability set for each ship class. The result of all thisis that, in other parts of Nova's data file, you can point to a dude class andknow that Nova will create a ship of the proper AI type and governmentalalignment, and will pick the new ship's type based on the probabilities you setin the dude resource. The dude resource's fields are:AIType             Which type of AI to use for ships of this dude class (see                     below).

Buzzes incoming ships to scan them                       for illegal cargo. Also acts as "piracy police" by                       attacking any ship that fires on or attempts to board                       another, non-enemy ship while the interceptor is                       watching.You can set different combinations of booty to be had from ships of a certaindude class by ORing different bits into the dude's Booty field. If a dude classhas a booty flag of 0x0000, then you can't get anything from the ship, andyou're told that you were "repelled while attempting to board" it. The differentbooty flags are documented aboveUnlike previous versions of the EV engine, Nova can handle dude resources thatare not completely filled - so, while the dude resource can handle references toas many as 16 different ship types, not all fields have to be used.

There can be up to eight different voice types,                   numbered 0-7. The voice resources are loaded from 'snd '                   resources as follows:                                        1000-1009   Voice type 0 acknowledgement speech                    1010-1019   Voice type 0 targeting speech                    1020-1029   Voice type 0 victory speech                    1100-1109   Voice type 1 acknowledgement speech                    1110-1119   Voice type 1 targeting speech                    1120-1129   Voice type 1 victory speech                    ...etc, up to:                    1700-1709   Voice type 7 acknowledgement speech                    1710-1719   Voice type 7 targeting speech                    1720-1729   Voice type 7 victory speech                                      If a particular set of voices (i.e. the acknowledgement,                   targeting, or victory sounds for a given voice type)                   contains an even number of sound resources, Nova will                   only use either the even- or odd-numbered sounds for                   each particular ship. The Nova scenario uses this to                   implement both male and female voices for certain                   governments. To let each ship decide for itself whether                   to use even- or odd-numbered sounds, set VoiceType to                   between 0 and 7. To force ships to use only odd-numbered                   sounds, set VoiceType to between 1000 and 1007.

A value of 100 will cause thisgovernment's ships to be just as skilled as any other ships of the same type. Avalue of 50 will cause this govt's ships to only be 50% as skilled, and a valueof 150 will cause this govt's ships to be 50% more skilled as the stock ship israted. This allows you to create governments whose pilots are more highlytrained than the stock pilots, so they can gain extra speed and accelerationfrom their ships.

The first six fields in a misn resource help Nova determine whereand when the mission is available:AvailStel       Which stellar objects (i.e. planets) the mission is                available at                -1           Any inhabited stellar                128-2175     ID number of a specific stellar                5000-7047    Stellar in a system adjacent to specific system                9999-10255   Specific govt's stellar                15000-15255  Specific govt's ally's stellar                20000-20255  Stellar of anybody but this specific govt                25000-25255  Specific govt's enemy's stellar                30000-30255  Stellar of specific govt or any of its class mates                31000-31255  Stellar not of specific govt nor of any of its                              class matesAvailLoc        Where on a planet this mission is available                0            From the mission computer                1            In the bar                2            Offered from ship (must set up associated p&euml;rs                               resource as well)                3            In the main spaceport dialog                4            In the trading dialog                5            In the shipyard dialog                6            In the outfit dialogAvailRecord     What your legal record in this system must be for this mission                to become available                0            ignored                pos. value   record must be at least this high                neg. value   record must be at least this low                -32000       when the player has dominated the stellar in                               question                -32001       when the player has dominated at least one stellarAvailRating     What your combat rating must be for this mission to be available                -1           ignored                0+           rating must be at least this highAvailRandom     A randomization factor, to ensure that some missions aren't                  available all the time.

If no text is entered here, Nova will use                the "Yes" button label from STR# 150 if the mission can be                refused, or the "Okay" button label if the mission is                non-refusable.RefuseButton    The label to use for the Refuse button in the initial mission                briefing dialog, for missions that can be refused. If no text                is entered here, Nova will use the "No" button label from                STR# 150.DispWeight      Controls the order that the mission is presented in the bar                and mission BBS list. Missions with higher DispWeight                values are presented first.     Whenever Nova displays a desc resource related to a mission, such as theinitial mission description (desc ID 4000-4255) or one of the special missionbriefings (e.g. CompText and QuickBrief) it performs one other special operationon the text. It searches through the text and replaces a few special "wildcard"symbols with pertinent mission information. This is extremely useful in settingup mission briefings that include random information that wouldn't be known whenthe description is written. These special symbols and their expansions are:&lt;DSY&gt;     The name of the destination system&lt;DST&gt;     The name of the destination stellar&lt;RSY&gt;     The name of the return system&lt;RST&gt;     The name of the return stellar&lt;CT&gt;      The name of the type of cargo to be carried&lt;CQ&gt;      The quantity of cargo to be carried&lt;DL&gt;      The date of the mission deadline, if any&lt;PAY&gt;     Absolute value of mission pay (does nothing if the mission pay            isn't monetary)&lt;REG&gt;     Who Nova is registered to, or "UNREGISTERED"&lt;PN&gt;      The player's name&lt;PNN&gt;     The player's nickname. If no nickname was specified, Nova will use            the player's full name here instead.&lt;PSN&gt;     The player's ship's name&lt;PST&gt;     The player's ship type (comes from the resource name of the player's            ship type's sh&iuml;p resource)&lt;PRK&gt;     The ConvName of the highest-weighted active rank resource. If none            is found, this will be replaced with "captain".&lt;SRK&gt;     The ShortName of the highest-weighted active rank resource. If none            is found, this will be replaced with "captain".&lt;PRKnnn&gt;  Same as &lt;PRK&gt;, but only for ranks affiliated with government ID nnn.            Note that you can only do this once per description, or bad things            might happen.&lt;SRKnnn&gt;  Same as &lt;SRK&gt;, but only for ranks affiliated with government ID nnn.            Note that you can only do this once per description, or bad things            might happen.&lt;RRK&gt;     The full name of the most recently activated rank resource. Note            that it's best to only use this in a mission briefing where you            know that you've just given the player a rank, because otherwise            bad things could happen. (e.g. the most recently activated rank            pointer isn't cached between game sessions)&lt;OSN&gt;     The offering ship name (only works when offering a mission from a            ship)&lt;SN&gt;      Special ship name (Note: Nova will screw up if you use this in the            initial mission description, as it doesn't pick the special ship            names until you actually accept the mission.)<b>Note:</b>Mission cargo names that start with the asterisk character ('*') are      treated as "quantityless" - i.e. their quantity is never shown in the      player-info dialog and the word "the" is omitted in the message that      appears when the player retrieves that type of cargo from a ship as      part of a mission. This is useful for when the mission cargo is a      proper name.<b>Note:</b>When Nova selects a random mission destination, it attempts to ensure      that the random destination is: a) more than two hyper jumps away from      the system where the mission is being offered, and b) a stellar which      is guaranteed to always exist throughout the course of the game,      regardless of system swapping. This means that if you have multiple      systems that occupy the same coordinates at different times in the game      and not all of them contain stellar object X, no missions will use      stellar object X as their random destination. (This is to keep the      player from accepting a mission with a random destination that might      cease to exist before he gets there!) A further important consequence      of this restriction is that if Nova detects that a mission whose      TravelStel or ReturnStel is to be randomly selected will violate this      rule, it will be prevented from being offered regardless of any other      availability parameters the mission might have - i.e. if you create a      mission and Nova refuses to make it available, check the debug log      to see if the mission couldn't find a suitable nontransient random      stellar of the desired characteristics.      <div class="divider"></div><a class="contentH2" name="nebu">The n&euml;bu resource</a>N&euml;bu resources contain info on the nebulae (or other space phenomena) whichare displayed in the background of the star map. These images don&rsquo;t actuallyhave any effect on events in the game, they&rsquo;re just there to look pretty. Youcan, however, combine n&euml;bu background images with custom asteroid orinterference data in the s&yuml;st resources for cool localized effects, and you canalso use the n&euml;bu resource's OnExplore field to enable events when the playerexplores a certain nebula.The PICT resources associated with the 32 available n&euml;bu resources are numbered9500-9724. Each nebula can have up to seven PICT resources associated with it;the first nebula's PICTs are 9500-96, the second's are 9507-13, etc. The enginewill pick the best nebula image to display for a given map scale (the map scalesused in Nova are 42.1%, 56.2%, 75.0%, 100.0%, 133.3%, 177.7%, and 237.0%). If anebula image of the proper size for the current map scale isn't available, Novawill pick the closest one and stretch it as necessary. PICTs for a given nebulashould be sorted by size in ascending order.The effects of the n&euml;bu resource&rsquo;s fields are as follows:XPos     The image&rsquo;s position on the star map. These coordinates areYPos       expressed in the scale of the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; map zoom level (not zoomed           in or out) and are relative to the upper-left corner of the image.XSize    The image&rsquo;s size on the star map. These values are expressed inYSize      the scale of the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; map zoom level (not zoomed in or out) and           tell Nova how big to make the image when the map is at normal           zoom.ActiveOn   Control bit test expression. Leave blank if unused. OnExplore  Control bit set expression that is evaluated whenever the nebula is            tested for visibility and found to be visible. Note that this field            is handled a little differently from other control bit set            expressions in Nova, because the explored state of the nebulae            isn't saved from game to game; rather, it is recalculated every            time based on the systems the player has explored. As a result,            this expression may get evaluated multiple times, so you shouldn't            use the random operator or any operators which do anything but            set or clear control bits here.<div class="divider"></div><a class="contentH2" name="oops">The &ouml;ops resource</a>Oops resources contain info on planetary disasters.

The only restriction on ModType2-4 is that you shouldn&rsquo;tuse it for weapons or ammo (modtypes 1 or 3).Availability    Control bit test expression. Leave blank if unused. Note that                depending on the configuration of other flags, the item might                appear in the outfit window even if Availability is false                (it will still not be able to be purchased)OnPurchase      Control bit set expression.

Values less than 1                 or greater than 100 are interpreted as 100.ShortName       The short string that is displayed in the outfit dialog menu for                 this item type. If you want to split this name into two                 separate  lines, put the characters "\n" into the name, e.g.:                 "Real Big\nScary Gun". When using this, lines that start with                 an alphanumeric character are drawn in white, while lines                 that start with other symbols are drawn in grey.                 LCName          The lower-case, singular name that's displayed in the                 player-info dialog and other places,                 e.g. "real big scary gun".                 LCPlural        The lower-case, plural name that's displayed in the player-info                 dialog and other places, e.g. "real big scary guns".RequireGovt     Which governments the outfit item's Require bits pertain to:                -1          Requirements apply in all outfit shops.                128-383     Requirements apply only on stellars belonging to                             this govt or its allies.                1128-1383   Requirements apply only on independent stellars and                             stellars belonging to this govt or its allies.                2128-2383   Requirements apply on all stellars except those                             belonging to this govt or its allies.                3128-3383   Requirements apply on all stellars except                             independent stellars or stellars belonging to                             this govt or its allies.<div class="divider"></div><a class="contentH2" name="pers">The p&euml;rs resource</a>The pers resource defines the characteristics of an AI personality - thatis, a specific person the player can encounter in the game. These AI-people havetheir names (which are also the names of the associated p&euml;rs resource) displayedon the target-info display in place of the name of their ship class. When shipsare created, there is a 5% chance that a specific AI-person will also becreated. (obviously, as AI-people are killed off, they cease to appear in thegame.) The first field tells Nova where a certain person can be encountered:LinkSyst       Which systems the person can be created in               -1              Any system               128-2175        ID of a specific system               9999-10255      Any system belonging to this specific government               15000-15255     Any system belonging to an ally of this govt               20000-20255     Any system belonging to any but this govt               25000-25255     Any system belonging to an enemy of this govtThe next four fields define the person's character traits:Govt           The person's governmental affiliation               -1              Ignored (person is independent)               128-383         ID of a specific governmentAI Type        The person's AI type (see the section on d&uuml;de resources)               1               Wimpy trader               2               Brave trader               3               Warship               4               InterceptorAggress        The person's aggression, i.e. how close ships have to be before                 the person will attack them, on a scale of 1 (close) to                 3 (far). Coward         At what percent of total shield capacity will the person run                 away from a fight? e.g. a value of 25 would cause the person                 to retreat when his shields dropped to 25%.The next fields tell Nova more about the ship that a person uses:ShipType      ID number of the person's ship classWeapType (x8)     ID numbers of weapon types                  -1 or 0     No weapon                  128-383     Add this weapon typeWeapCount (x8)    How many of each of the above weapons to add (Note: This is                    in addition to the standard weapons already included with                    the ship. Standard weapons can be "removed" by entering                    their ID numbers in the WeapType fields and entering the                    negative of their standard load for the given ship class in                    the WeapCount field.)                  -1 or 0        None                  1 and up       Add this manyAmmoLoad (x8)     The standard ammo load for weapons that need it, or ignored                    for those that don&rsquo;t                  -1 or 0        No ammo                  1 and up       Include this many rounds of ammoCredits           How many credits the person carries                  0              ignored (no credits)                  1 and up       This many credits, +/- 25%ShieldMod         How much to increase/decrease the person's shield capacity,                     in percent. For example, a value of 130 entered here would                    make the person's ship have shields that are 30% stronger                    than if he were flying a stock ship. Similarly, a value of                    70 would make his shields 30% weaker. A value less than                    zero makes this person invincible.The next fields tell Nova about any special quotes or missions to link to thisship:HailPict          ID number of a PICT resource to be displayed in the                    communications dialog instead of the standard picture                    for this person's ship typeCommQuote         Index number of an entry in STR# resource 7100, to be                    displayed in the communications dialogHailQuote         Index number of an entry in STR# resource 7101, to be                    displayed at the bottom of the game screen (i.e. over the                    radio)LinkMission       What mission to activate when the ship is boarded or hailedFlags             Some control bits     0x0001       The special ship will hold a grudge if attacked, and will                    subsequently attack the player wherever the twain shall                    meet.     0x0002       Uses escape pod &amp; has afterburner     0x0004       HailQuote only shown when ship has a grudge against the                    player     0x0008       HailQuote only shown when ship likes player     0x0010       Only show HailQuote when ship begins to attack the player     0x0020       Only show HailQuote when ship is disabled     0x0040       When LinkMission is accepted with a single SpecialShip,                   replace it with this ship while removing this one from play.                   This is generally only useful for escort and refuel-a-ship                   missions.

Each resource-box is worth 1 unit               of whatever cargo is defined in the YieldType field to be               granted when a scoop-equipped ship runs over it.PartCount    The number of particles that are thrown off when an asteroid               of this type is destroyed.               PartColor    The color of the particles, encoded the same as HTML colors.              (00RRGGBB)FragType1&amp;2  Asteroids can break up into some number of sub-asteroids when               destroyed. If both of these fields are used, Nova will               randomly pick between them for each sub-asteroid that is               created. If only one is used, all sub-asteroids will be of               that type.                              128-143    Generate this type of sub-asteroid               -1         No sub-asteroidsFragCount    The average number of sub-asteroids (+/- 50%) to be generated               when an asteroid of this type is destroyed (zero for none).ExplodeType  Type of explosion to show (0-63) when an asteroid of this type               is destroyed. You can also add 1000 to the value of this field in               the same manner as the ExplodeType field in the w&euml;ap resource.               Set to -1 to not show any explosion.Mass         Mass of this asteroid type (used when weapons hit asteroids)<div class="divider"></div><a class="contentH2" name="ship">The sh&iuml;p resource</a>Spaceships are the heart of Nova, so the ship resource contains a lot ofinfo. The name of a ship class, which is seen in the targeting display,corresponds to the name of the ship resource. The first nine fields give Novasome general performance info on each ship type:Holds             Cargo capacity, in tons. Put a negative sign in front of this                    value if you want to prevent the player from purchasing                    mass expansions. (e.g. a value of -100 would mean 100 tons                    of hold space but no mass expansions allowed)Shield            Shield strength.Accel             Acceleration magnitude. 300 is considered an average value.Speed             Top speed. 300 is also an average value here.Maneuver          Turn rate. 10 &asymp; 30&deg;/sec.Fuel              Fuel capacity. 100 = 1 jump.FreeMass          Space available to add additional items and upgrades. Note                    that this is in addition to the space taken up by the                    ship&rsquo;s stock weapons. (e.g. a ship with 20 tons listed in                    FreeMass and 10 tons of stock weapons will actually have 30                    tons of expansion space, with 20 available.)Armor             Armor strength.ShieldRech        Shield recharge speed, in number of shield points x1000 per                    frame. Bigger numbers here mean faster recharge - a value                    of 1000 is equal to 1 point per frame or 30 points per                    second.The next twelve fields tell Nova which stock weapons to put on your ship whenyou first buy it:WeapType (x8)     ID numbers of weapon types                  -1 or 0     No weapon                  128-191     Add this weapon typeWeapCount (x8)    How many of each of the above weapons to add                  -1 or 0     None                   1 and up   Add this manyAmmoLoad (x8)     The standard ammo load for weapons that need it, or ignored                    for those that don&rsquo;t                  -1 or 0     No ammo                   1 and up   Include this many rounds of ammoThe next two fields tell Nova what this ship&rsquo;s maximum loadout of fixed guns andturreted weapons is. Each ship has an inherent upper limit on fixed guns andturrets, in order to keep them from becoming absurdly powerful. (e.g. a bulkfreighter has lots of room to add weapons, but is limited to a single turret fordefense) The fields are:MaxGun     The ship&rsquo;s maximum number of fixed guns, which are flagged in the             WeapFlag field of the outf resource.MaxTur     The ship&rsquo;s maximum number of turrets, which are flagged in the             WeapFlag field of the outf resource.The next field tells Nova where this ship is available for purchase:TechLevel     What the technology level of the ship is. This ship will be                available at all shipyards with a tech level of this value or                higher. (The exception to this rule involves the SpecialTech                fields of the sp&ouml;b resource; see the section on sp&ouml;b resources                for more information.)The next field, Cost, tells Nova how much to charge you when you buy this ship.The cost of buying a ship is always the cost of the new ship minus 25% of theoriginal cost of your current ship and upgrades. (i.e. you always "trade up" toa new ship) The next field stores info on how the ship explodes:DeathDelay      The number of frames the ship "disintegrates" before finally                  exploding.      0-59      The ship disintegrates for this number of frames and then                  disappears in a single fireball.      60+       The ship disintegrates for this number of frames and then                  disappears in a huge explosion. The exact size of the                  resulting fireball is proportional to the ship's mass. (see                  below)ArmorRech       Armor recharge speed, in number of armor points x1000 per                    frame. Bigger numbers here mean faster recharge - a value                    of 1000 is equal to 1 point per frame or 30 points per                    second.Explode1       Type of explosion to show (0-63) while the ship is breaking up,                 or -1 to not show any explosions until the ship is finished                 being destroyed.                 Explode2       Type of explosion to show (0-63) when the ship is completely                 destroyed. You can also add 1000 to the value of this field in                 the same manner as the ExplodeType field in the w&euml;ap resource.                 Set to -1 to not show any explosion when the ship is                 destroyed.DispWeight     The display weight of this ship type. Ships with a higher                 display weight are shown closer to the top of the shipyard                 dialog. This can be used to effectively rearrange the order                 in which ships are displayed without rearranging the                 resources themselves.Mass           The mass of the ship, in tons. This doesn't affect acceleration                 or speed at all, but it does affect travel time in hyperspace                 and the display on the density scanner. Also, the blast radius                 and impact strength when the ship explodes is proportional to                 its mass.  1-99         1 day per jump, small blip on density scanner  100-199      2 days per jump, large blip on density scanner  200 and up   3 days per jump, large blip on density scannerLength     The ship's length in meters. Currently unused in any calculations,             but it&rsquo;s kinda cool, so it&rsquo;s displayed in the "detailed ship info"             dialog.The next field tells Nova what kind of AI the ship will have if it's not createdin connection with a dude resource. The only place this field is useful is whena ship is created as an escort ship; otherwise, it's ignored:InherentAI     What AI the ship uses when it's escorting the player.       1-4     Use this kind of AI. (see the AI descriptions above) Note               that only ships with inherent AI of 1 or 2 can be used to               carry cargo when they are the player's escorts.Crew           Number of crew members. Ships with 0 crew can't be boarded,                 nor can they capture any other ships.Strength       An arbitrary value that represents the relative strength of                 the ship type with respect to the rest of the universe.                 Used when calculating combat odds (see the govt resource                 for details).The next field tells Nova what government is associated with a ship type.Note that unlike previous EV games, Nova actually handles two inherentgovernment associations for each ship type: an inherent combat govt(used when an AI ship or stellar is deciding if it likes or hates anothership) and an inherent attributes govt (used for non-combat things likevoice type, distress message flags, etc). Sometimes you might want tocreate a ship type that inherits attributes from a particular govt butisn't considered to be inherently of that govt in combat, so Nova letsyou use the InherentGovt field in several different ways:InherentGovt     -1          No inherent combat govt or inherent attributes                              govt for this ship                 128-383     Ship is treated as being inherently of the                              govt with this ID, both for AI combat                              and attributes inheritance)                 1128-1383   Ship has an inherent attributes govt with                              this ID (minus 1000) but no inherent                              combat govt.                 2128-2383   Ship has an inherent combat govt with                              this ID (minus 2000) but no inherent                              attributes govt.The next field is for some miscellaneous flags:Flags        0x0001     Slow jumping (75% normal speed)             0x0002     Semi-fast jumping (125%)             0x0004     Fast jumping (150%)             0x0008     Player ship takes advantage of FuelRegen property             0x0010     Ship is disabled at 10% armor instead of 33%             0x0020     Ship has afterburner when player has an advanced combat                           rating             0x0040     Ship always has afterburner (for AIs only)             0x0100     Show % armor on target display instead of &ldquo;Shields                          Down&rdquo;             0x0200     Don't show armor or shield state on status display             0x0400     Ship is a planet-type ship, and can only be hit by                          planet-type weapons             0x1000     Ship&rsquo;s turrets have a blind spot to the front             0x2000     Ship&rsquo;s turrets have a blind spot to the sides             0x4000     Ship&rsquo;s turrets have a blind spot to the rear             0x8000     Ship is an escape ship type - if the player is carrying                          any ships of this type and decides to eject, he will                          fly off in a ship of this type (with random damage)                          instead of an escape pod.PodCount     For decorative purposes, AI ships can be made to launch escape             pods when they're destroyed. This field contains the standard             number of escape pods for an AI ship of this type to launch when             destroyed, at a rate of one per second. Note that this has nothing             to do with the p&euml;rs field's escape pod flag, it's just for eye             candy. Don't overuse this field, as it can be annoying if used             too often. (perhaps restrict it only to luxury liner type ships).DefaultItems   Up to eight default items with which to equip this ship when the                 player buys or captures one. Note that AI-controlled ships                 will ignore these fields; also, don&rsquo;t put anything in here                 that isn&rsquo;t a physical item - i.e. afterburners, shield                 boosters, and the like are okay, but no fake IDs, maps, etc.               128-255    Ship comes stock with this item               -1         IgnoredItemCount      The number of each DefaultItem with which to equip the player.FuelRegen      This ship type&rsquo;s inherent fuel regeneration property. Works                 exactly the same as the fuel scoop ModVal property - useful                 for making ships with built-in fuel replenishment. Note that                 for the player to be able to use this field, the 0x0008 flag                 must also be set. (this allows you to give enemy ships                 built-in fuel scoops but still make the player have to buy his                 own)SkillVar       The amount (in percent) to which this ship&rsquo;s pilots&rsquo; skill                 varies. This affects acceleration and turn rate for each ship:                 i.e. a skill variance of 10% would make each ship of a given                 type up to 10% slower or faster than &ldquo;stock&rdquo;. Values from                 1 to 50% are valid.                           Flags2         0x0001    Ship exhibits swarming behavior               0x0002    Ship prefers standoff attacks               0x0004    Ship can't be targeted               0x0008    Ship can be fired on by point defense systems               0x0010    Don't use fighter voices               0x0020    Ship can jump without slowing down               0x0040    Ship is inertialess               0x0080    AI ships of this type will run away/dock if out of                           ammo for all ammo-using weapons               0x0100    AI ships of this type will cloak when their weapon                           goes into burst reload               0x0200    AI ships will cloak when running away               0x0400    AI ships will cloak when hyperspacing               0x0800    AI ships will cloak when just flying around               0x1000    AI ships will not uncloak until close to their target               0x2000    AI ships will cloak when docking               0x4000    AI ships will cloak when preemptively attacked Availability   Control bit test expression. The player will be able to purchase               this type of ship when the expression evaluates to true. Leave               blank if unused. Depending on the configuration of other flags,               the ship might appear in the shipyard but not be able to be               purchased if its Availability evaluates to false. AppearOn       Control bit test expression. Ships of this type will not show up               in dude resources if this expression evaluates to false. Leave               blank if unused.               OnPurchase     Control bit set expression. Leave blank if unused. Deionize       The rate at which this ship type dissipates ionization charge.               A value of 100 equals 1 point of ion energy per 1/30th of a               second. Higher values for Deionize yield faster ion charge               dissipation.               IonizeMax      The amount of ion charge at which a ship of this type will be               considered "fully ionized".               KeyCarried     The key carried ship type, used for interesting effects in                the w&euml;ap and sh&auml;n resources.DefaultItms2   More default items, used as aboveItemCountContribute      These two Contribute fields together form a 64-bit flag that isContribute      subsequently combined with the Contribute fields from the                outfit items in the player's possession, to be used with the                Require fields in the outf and misn resources.Require        These two Require fields together form a 64-bit flag that isRequire         logically and'ed with the Contribute fields from the player's                current ship and outfit items. If for each 1 bit in the Require                fields there is a matching 1 bit in one or more of the                Contribute fields, the ship can be purchased. Leave these                set to zero if unused. Depending on the configuration of other                flags, the ship might appear in the shipyard but not be able to                be purchased if the player doesn't meet the Requirements.BuyRandom      The percent chance that a ship of this type will be available for                 purchase on a given day. A BuyRandom of 0 means this ship will                 never be made available for purchase.HireRandom     The percent chance that a ship of this type will be available for                 hire in the bar on a given day. A HireRandom of 0 means this                 ship will never be made available for hire.OnCapture      Control bit set expression, evaluated when you capture a ship of                 this type. Leave blank if unused. OnRetire       Control bit set expression, evaluated when you sell a ship of                 this type and/or replace it with a captured ship.Subtitle       The subtitle to show on the target display for this ship typeFlags3         Even more flags!               0x0001    Ship destroys asteroids               0x0002    Ship scoops asteroid debris               0x0010    Ship ignores gravity               0x0020    Ship ignores deadly stellars               0x0040    Ship's turreted shots appear above the ship instead                          of below               0x0100    Don't show ship in shipyard if Availability is false               0x0200    Don't show ship in shipyard if Require bits not met               0x4000    When this ship is available for sale, it prevents all                          higher-numbered ship types with equal DispWeight from                          being made available for sale at the same time.UpgradeTo      If an escort ship of this type can be upgraded, this field holds                the ID of the ship type that it can be upgraded to. Set to 0 or                -1 if this ship class can't be upgraded.                EscUpgrdCost   The cost to upgrade an escort ship of this type to the next more                advanced version, as defined in the UpgradeTo field.EscSellValue   The amount of cash the player gets for selling off a captured                escort of this type. If you input a number that's less than or                equal to zero here, Nova will default to 10% of the ship's                original cost.EscortType     Tells Nova which of the four categories of escorts to put this                ship type into when organizing the escort control menu.                -1  Have the game try to figure it out at runtime                 0  Fighter                 1  Medium Ship                 2  Warship                 3  FreighterShortName     The short string that is displayed in the shipyard dialog menu               for this ship type. If you want to split this name into two               separate  lines, put the characters "\n" into the name, e.g.:               "Big Ship\n(used)". When using this, lines that start with               an alphanumeric character are drawn in white, while lines               that start with other symbols are drawn in grey.CommName       The short string to display for this ship when it is hailed by                the player.Long Name      The long string to display when the player purchases a ship of                this type or starts a new pilot.                MovieFile      The filename of a QuickTime movie to display in place of the                ship picture  in the shipyard dialog. The QuickTime movie must                reside within the Nova Files or Nova Plug-Ins folders and will                be looped continuously while the player has this ship type                selected.Ships' target info picts are stored in PICT resources 3000 and on. The engine issmart enough to reuse targeting picts for two ship classes that have the samebase sprites: all you have to do is give the first of any series ofidentical-looking ship types a target pict in the usual way (PICT resource ID3000 + shipID - 128) and the engine will use it for all higher-numbered shiptypes with the same base sprites.<div class="divider"></div><a class="contentH2" name="spob">The sp&ouml;b resource</a>Spob resources describe stellar objects, such as planets and spacestations. (spob stands for space object) Each spob resource represents onestellar object, whose name is the name as the name of the resource. The firstthree fields tell Nova where to put the stellar and what graphics to use for it:xPos &amp; yPos     The stellar's X and Y positions in the system (0, 0) is centeredType            Which graphic to use, from 0 to 255.The next field stores the flag bits that tell Nova what many of thecharacteristics of the stellar are. Perform an OR operation on the followingflags to get the final flag value:0x00000001     Can land/dock here0x00000002     Has commodity exchange0x00000004     Can outfit ship here0x00000008     Can buy ships here0x00000010     Stellar is a station instead of a planet0x00000020     Stellar is uninhabited (no traffic control or refuelling)0x00000040     Has bar0x00000080     Can only land here if stellar is destroyed first0x00000000     Won't trade in food0x10000000     Low food prices0x20000000     Medium food prices0x40000000     High food prices0x00000000     Won't trade in industrial goods0x01000000     Low industrial prices0x02000000     Medium industrial prices0x04000000     High industrial prices0x00000000     Won't trade in medical supplies0x00100000     Low medical prices0x00200000     Medium medical prices0x00400000     High medical prices0x00000000     Won't trade in luxury goods0x00010000     Low luxury prices0x00020000     Medium luxury prices0x00040000     High luxury prices0x00000000     Won't trade in metal0x00001000     Low metal prices0x00002000     Medium metal prices0x00004000     High metal prices0x00000000     Won't trade in equipment0x00000100     Low equipment prices0x00000200     Medium equipment prices0x00000400     High equipment pricesTribute        The stellar's tribute payout when dominated               -1 or 0     Default amount (1000 credits x Tech Level)               1 and up    This number of credits per dayThe next fields tell Nova what items and ships are available for purchaseat this stellar:TechLevel     What the base tech level of the stellar is. Only items and ships                with TechLevels at or below this value will be available.SpecialTech (x8)     Holds the special tech levels of this stellar. Unlike the                       previous field, only items and ships with exactly this                       TechLevel will appear here. This is useful for making                       low-tech worlds that also have a few high-tech items, or                       for flagging an item with an absurdly high TechLevel                       (say 15000) and then setting one of the SpecialTech                       fields of a particular stellar to that same value, thus                       making that item appear at that stellar and nowhere                       else.The next two fields contain info on the stellar's governmental affiliation:Govt      What government controls this stellar          -1          ignored (stellar is independent)          128-383     ID number of the stellar's governmentMinStatus        The point on your record in the current system that you'll be                   denied landing clearance on this stellar.                 -32767           Ignored (player can always land)                 -1 to -32766     You can be this evil before they shun you                  0 to 32766      They have to like you this much before they                                    let you land                  32767           Player can never land.                  (Note that this field is ignored if the stellar is                   uninhabited)The next pair of fields tells Nova which special landscape to show and whichambient sound to play.CustPicID         Which custom landscape to show                  128 and up        ID number of PICT to load instead of the                                      standard landscape display                  less than 128     No custom landscape                  (Note: for animated hypergates, this field can be optionally                   used to set the index of the transition between the                   "opening/closing" animation and the "working"                   animation. Set to 0 to have the engine use the first                   half of the frames for "opening/closing" and the                   second half for "working".)CustSndID         Which ambient sound to play                  -1                No ambient sound effect                  Anything else     ID number of snd resource to load                   (Note: for hypergates and wormholes, this field serves                   a different purpose - it controls the angle at which                   ships emerge. Values between 0 and 359 specify an                   exact angle, while any other value specifies a                   random direction.)The next two fields tell Nova what kind of ships, if any, to create for theplanet's defense fleet:DefenseDude       Which type of dude to use for the defense fleet:                  -1         Ignored (no defense ships)                   128-639   ID number of the dude resource to use to determine                               the defense ships' characteristicsDefCount     The number of ships in the defense fleet. If you set this number               to be above 1000, ships will be launched from the planet or               station in waves. The last number in this field is the number of               ships in each wave, and the first 3-4 numbers (minus 1 from the               first digit) are the total number of ships in the planet's               fleet. For example, a value of 1082 would be four waves of two               ships for a total of eight. A value of 2005 would create waves               of five ships each, with 100 ships total in the planet's defense               fleet.Flags2      0x0001      For an animated stellar, the first frame will be                          shown after each subsequent frame.            0x0002      For an animated stellar, the next frame in the                          sequence will be picked at random. The same frame                          will not be picked twice in a row. Note that this                          can be combined with the previous flag and the                          Frame0Bias field to create interesting effects                          such as random planetary lightning or lights                          twinkling.            0x0010      Play this stellar's sound in a continuous loop            0x0020      Stellar is always dominated (all your base are                                                     belong to us)            0x0040      Stellar starts the game destroyed            0x0080      For an animated stellar, the stellar's graphic is                          animated after it's been destroyed and static                          when it is not destroyed. The normal behavior                          is the opposite of this: static when destroyed                          and animated when not.            0x0100      Stellar is deadly - all ships that touch it are                          destroyed immediately            0x0200      If the stellar has a weapon, it will only fire when                          provoked (i.e. only when the player is trying to                          dominate it)            0x0400      If the stellar has an outfit shop, it can buy                          any nonpermanent outfits the player owns,                          regardless of tech level            0x1000      Stellar is a hypergate - if the player lands on it                          he will be given a choice of which other hypergate                          to travel to (see HyperLink1-8 below)            0x2000      Stellar is a wormhole - if the player lands on it                          he will be transported to some other random                          somewhere in the galaxy. If all of the                          wormhole's HyperLink1-8 fields set to -1,                          the player will end up at another random                          wormhole which also has no defined hyper links.                          If the wormhole has any hyper links defined,                          the player will end up at one of the wormholes                          on the other end.                                      AnimDelay   The time to wait between frames, in 30ths of a second.Frame0Bias  If greater than 1, this is used as a multiplier to extend the              display time of the first frame in the sequence. For example,              a Frame0Bias of 3 would cause the first frame in the sequence              would be held for three times longer than the rest of the frames.HyperLink1-8    IDs of the sp&ouml;b resources of up to eight other hypergates or                 wormholes to which this hypergate (or wormhole) is connected.                 Set to zero or -1 if unused. For a wormhole, setting every                 HyperLink field to -1 will cause the wormhole to randomly                 connect to any other random wormhole when the player goes                 through it.OnDominate      Control bit set expression which is evaluated when the stellar                 is successfully dominated by the playerOnRelease       Control bit set expression which is evaluated when the stellar                 is released from domination by the player                 Fee             The fee that is deducted from the player's credits when landing                 on this stellar. Set to zero if unused.Gravity         The stellar's gravity - 0 for none, positive for stellars that                 pull, negative for stellars that push. Beware! This feature                 is mostly here for laughs. It severely confuses the AI, so it                 should only be used in empty systems where only the player                 can go.                 Weapon          Stellars can have a single projectile or missile type weapon,                  with unlimited ammunition (don't put the ID of a beam or PD                  weapon here or bad things will happen). Stellars' weapons can                  be made to fire either only when provoked or any time an                  enemy ship is present.                 0 or -1    No weapon                 128-383    Stellar has a weapon of this typeStrength        The amount of combined mass and energy damage this stellar can                 take from planetary-type weapons before it is destroyed.

You can pull off some cool tricks with this field, includingpresenting the illusion that system has changed in some way by hiding theoriginal system and replacing it with a copy that is identical except for thedesired changes. The Visibility field is a control bit test expression - leaveit blank if unused.<b>Note:</b>Using the Visibility field to replace one system with another will workfine as long as they have the exact same coordinates (that's how Nova knowsto update the hyper links, etc.)  But, if you're going to have systemsreplacing each other in response to ncb changes, be sure that the Visibilityfields of all the systems are mutually exclusive, or the resulting behaviorwill be undefined and probably incorrect.BkgndColor     The system's background color, encoded the same as HTML colors.                 (RRGGBB)  ...set to zero for pure black.Murk           The murkiness of the system (0-100).

A value less than zero                 is equivalent to zero murk but also hides the starfield.AstTypes       Flag bits that determine what types of asteroids will appear               in this system:               0x0001    Small metal   (r&ouml;id ID 128)               0x0002    Medium metal  (r&ouml;id ID 129)               0x0004    Large metal   (r&ouml;id ID 130)               0x0008    Huge metal    (r&ouml;id ID 131)               0x0010    Small ice     (r&ouml;id ID 132)               0x0020    Medium ice    (r&ouml;id ID 133)               etc.                ReinfFleet     The ID of a fleet to use as this system's reinforcement fleet.                 If ships allied with the reinforcement fleet's government are                 under attack and the combat odds against them exceed the                 MaxOdds field of the reinforcement fleet's government, the                 reinforcement fleet will be called in. Set to 0 or -1 if                 unused.ReinfTime      The delay between the time the reinforcement call goes out and                 the time the fleet appears. A value of 30 = one second.                 ReinfIntrval   The interval, in days, that it takes for the reinforcement fleet                 to be regenerated. If you set this to 0, a reinforcement fleet                 will be available every day. If you set this higher than zero,                 it will take that number of days for the reinforcement fleet                 to be available again.                 <div class="divider"></div><a class="contentH2" name="weap">The w&euml;ap resource</a>The weap resource, surprisingly, stores info on Nova's weapons. The name ofthe weap resource is used as the weapon name in the weaponry section of thestatus display. The first two fields control the duration of different aspectsof the weapon:Reload                  The number of frames it takes for one of this weapon to                          reload. 30 = 1 shot/sec. Smaller numbers yield faster                          reloads.Count                   The number of frames the weapon's shots travel for                          before they peter out. 30 = 1 second of life.The next two fields, MassDmg and EnergyDmg, tell Nova how much damage to dowhen one of this weapon's shots hits something. Energy damage does damage toshields only, and mass damage does damage to armor only. Further, if a shiphas shields, its armor can't be damaged until its shields are knocked down(unless the weapon is a shield-penetrating weapon).The next two fields tell Nova how the weapon should behave in flight:Guidance      The weapon's guidance mode              -1      Unguided projectile               0      Beam weapon (see below)               1      Homing weapon (see Seeker field below)               2      (unused)               3      Turreted beam               4      Turreted, unguided projectile               5      Freefall bomb (launched at 80% of the ship's                        current velocity, "weathervanes" into the "wind."               6      Freeflight rocket (launched straight ahead, accelerates                        to its maximum velocity)               7      Front-quadrant turret, (can fire +/-45&deg; off the ship's                        nose) fires straight ahead if no target               8      Rear-quadrant turret (can fire +/-45&deg; off the ship's tail)               9      Point defense turret (fires automatically at incoming                        guided weapons and nearby ships)               10     Point defense beam (fires automatically at incoming                        guided weapons and nearby ships)               99     Carried ship (AmmoType is the ID of the ship class)Speed         The weapon's speed (pixels per frame * 100)The next field tells Nova how to handle the ammunition for this weapon, assumingit&rsquo;s not a fighter bay:AmmoType       What kind of ammo the weapon uses               -1               Ignored (unlimited ammo)                0-255           Draws ammo from this type of weapon.

However, you                                  could conceivably set it to use ammo from                                  another weapon's supply by setting the                                  AmmoType to something else.)               -999             Ship is destroyed when weapon is fired               -1000 &amp;

A BeamWidth of 0 will                 have no center beam, just corona glow.                 Note: Lightning beams require a BeamWidth or 1 or greater.                 Note: For sprite-based weapons that spin continuously, this                       field controls the time between frames, in 30ths of                       a second.                  Falloff        The corona falloff. Higher numbers make the corona fall off                 faster. This value must be between 2 and 16. (since lightning                 beams have no corona, this is ignored for lightning beams)                 BeamColor      The color of the beam center, encoded as a 24-bit RGB value                  (00RRGGBB).                  CoronaColor    The color of the beam corona, encoded as a 24-bit RGB value.                  Note that since the corona is translucent, it will appear                  approximately half as bright at its maximum as what you                  specify in this field. (since lightning beams have no corona,                  this is ignored for lightning beams)SubCount       The number of submunitions to create when the shot reaches the                  end of its life or detonates because something wanders into                  its proximity radius. Set to 0 or -1 if unused.                  SubType        The resource ID of the weapon type to create as submunitions.                  Anything except beams and fighters is handled.                  SubTheta       The angular error of the submunitions as they are launched,                  as expressed in degrees error from the carrier weapons'                  heading.SubLimit       If you have defined a recursively-submunitioning weapon (i.e.                  one which splits into more copies of itself) this field                  will allow you to limit the number of recursive splits                  that happen. This field is ignored if the weapon is                  not recursively submunitioning.ProxSafety     A time delay for the weapon's proximity fuse, in 30ths of a                 second.

When a ship is ionized it becomes nearly               immobilized until the ionization charge dissipates.               HitParticles   The number of particles to generate when a shot of this type hits               a ship or asteroid. Set to zero if unused.               HitPartLife    The average life (in frames) of the hit-particles.               HitPartVel     The speed of the hit-particles; a value of 100 is one pixel               per frame.               HitPartColor   The color of the hit-particles, encoded as a 24-bit HTML color               (00RRGGBB)               ExitType       The type of weapon exit point to use for this weapon:               -1   Ignored - weapon will fire from the center of the ship                0   GunPosX/Y                1   TurretPosX/Y                2   GuidedPosX/Y                3   BeamPosX/Y                BurstCount     The number of shots this weapon can fire before having to endure                 a burst reload. Set to 0 or -1 if unused.  For weapons that do                 not fire simultaneously, this value will be multiplied by how                 many of this weapon the firing ship has - for example, a                 weapon with a BurstCount of 4 on a ship with 3 of that weapon                 will be able to fire 12 times before entering the burst reload                 period. For weapons that fire simultaneously, this value is                 independent of how many of the weapon the ship has.                 BurstReload    The reload time that is imposed when the weapon has fired &gt;=                 BurstCount shots. Ignored if BurstCount is 0 or -1.                         JamVuln1-4     The weapon's vulnerability to the four different types of                 jamming, from 0 to 100%. Ignored if the weapon is not a                 guided weapon.                 Flags3         0x0001  Weapon will only use ammo at the end of a burst cycle               0x0002  Weapon's shots are translucent               0x0004  Firing ship can't fire another shot of this type until                        the previous one expires or hits something.               0x0010  Weapon fires from whatever weapon exit point is closest                        to the target               0x0020  Weapon is exclusive - no other weapons on the ship can                        fire while this weapon is firing or reloading             Durability     For guided weapons, this is how many point defense hits a shot                from this weapon can take before it is destroyed. Set to 0 for                weapons that are immediately destroyed by any PD hits. Ignored                for non-guided projectile weapons or beams. (PD damage to                guided weapons is calculated as 100% of mass damage plus                50% of energy damage)                GuidedTurn     For guided weapons, this is the turning speed of the weapon.                Higher values yield more maneuverable missiles. Ignored for                anything but guided weapons.                MaxAmmo        For ammo-using weapons, this is the maximum amount of ammo                per each instance of this weapon. (so, if you have two of these                weapons, the max amount of ammo for that weapon type would                actually be twice MaxAmmo, and so on)  Set to 0 or -1 if you                want the ammo quantity to be constrained by the o&uuml;tf                resource's Max field instead.Recoil         The amount of recoil force to apply to the firing ship when                this weapon is used:                0 or -1            No recoil                Positive values    Thrust the ship backwards                Negative values    Thrust the ship forwards                (note that the resulting change to the ship's velocity is                 inversely proportional to its mass)LiDensity      For a beam weapon, entering zero in this field will make it a                normal, straight beam weapon. Entering a value greater than                zero will make the beam a lightning beam, which has no                real effect other than to make it look cool. The number you                enter here is the number of zig-zags the beam will make per                100 pixels. Higher numbers yield more convoluted beams. Note                also that lightning beams can't have a beam corona, and so                will only use the CoreColor and CoreWidth fields above.LiAmplitude    The amplitude of each zig-zag of a lightning beam, in pixels.                Higher numbers yield more jagged-looking beams. Don't overdo                this or you will have screen redraw problems. In fact, don't                overuse lightning beams period, as they are much more                processor-intensive to draw than normal beams!IonizeColor    The color that a ship hit by this weapon will appear after being                sufficiently ionized (encoded the same as an HTML color value).                A value of 0 here will be interpreted as a default bluish                color. Using fairly bright colors here is probably the best,                as low-intensity colors tend to look odd when used as the                ionization color.Please note that if you've set the weapon to be a beam (Guidance of 0 or 3) thefollowing fields have different functions:Count          The number of frames the beam stays onscreen. Note also that if                the beam has a positive Decay value entered (see below) the                actual time the beam will exist onscreen will be                Count + 16 - CoronaFalloff, so adjust the Reload value                accordingly to ensure that the universe doesn't get filled                up with overlapping beams from a single ships.Impact         Functions normally, with one exception: if the impact is set to                a negative value, the beam acts as a tractor beam. Smaller                ships will be pulled towards the firing ship with a strength                proportional to the Impact value, while a small ship                firing a tractor beam at a larger ship (or asteroid) will                "latch on" to it and be dragged along. Note that you cannot                enter hyperspace if held by a tractor beam from a ship that's                larger than you are. Note also that inertialess ships are not                affected by tractor beams.ProxRadius     IgnoredBlastRadius    IgnoredDecay          If Decay is greater than zero, the beam will "shrink" before it                disappears from the screen. The actual time the beam spends on                screen will be Count + 16 - CoronaFalloff in this case, so                adjust your Reload value accordingly (otherwise you'll get too                many beams onscreen at once).Another Note:  If you don't create an o&uuml;tf resource for each weapon type, yourship's weapon loadout will be corrupted when you land on a planet.(specifically, Nova will mistakenly remove any weapons for which you didn'tcreate o&uuml;tf resources)  Also, having multiple outfit items that bestow theuser with the same weapon type can cause weird things to happen.<div class="divider"></div><a class="contentH2" name="appendix i">Appendix I - Combat Ratings</a>Your combat rating is based on the number of kills you have made, which is thesum of the strengths of all the ships you have destroyed, times some internalmultiplier for adjustment.

For example, a pluginfor a new ship would have to replace several of the built-in STR# resources toincorporate its new name into the game. The problem arises when you want to usetwo plugins that try to modify the same STR# resource.The solution is not to change the STR# resources at all, but to use Nova&rsquo;s handystring patching functionality by updating only select strings in a STR# resourceby providing Nova with a properly-numbered 'STR ' resource. For example, tochange the first cargo type from food to something else, you&rsquo;d simply create a'STR ' resource with the ID 9000 and type in the name of your new commodity. Achart of 'STR ' resource numbers is provided below:String Type:                                        Replacement 'STR ' ID range:Message buoys                                       1000-2500Hail quotes                                         5000-5511Stellar types                                       7000-7063Base prices of commodities                          9300-9305Commodity abbreviations for status display          9400-9405Govt-specific greetings for comm dialog           10000-12559 (first 10 for                                                    govt -1, second 10 for                                                    govt 0, third 10 for govt                                                    1, etc.)p&euml;rs-resource CommQuotes                          15000-15511<div class="divider"></div><a class="contentH2" name="appendix iv">Appendix IV - Log Files</a>Nova supports two different kinds of debug log output that are useful toplugin developers:1. If you create a file called "debuglog.txt" in your Nova folder, a large   amount of debug info will be dumped into this file as the game runs.   Further, enabling this output also turns on some additional error checking,   which can be very handy for finding errors in plugins.   2. If you create a file called "pilotlog.txt" in your Nova folder, every time   a pilot file is opened its contents will be written in human-readable   form to the pilotlog.txt file. (works only after registering)<div class="divider"></div><a class="contentH2" name="appendix v">Appendix V - Errata</a>
